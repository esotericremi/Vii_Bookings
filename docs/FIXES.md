# VII Bookings App Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the reported issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logout Functionality
- **Issue**: Logout was not working properly
- **Fix**: Enhanced the `signOut` function in `AuthContext.tsx` to:
  - Clear local state immediately
  - Handle errors gracefully
  - Force redirect to login page
  - Provide better error handling

### 2. ✅ Sidebar Navigation
- **Issue**: Menu bar should be converted to a sidebar
- **Fix**: 
  - Created new `AppSidebar.tsx` component using Radix UI Sidebar
  - Replaced horizontal navigation with collapsible sidebar
  - Added proper user profile section in sidebar footer
  - Integrated with existing navigation logic
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 3. ✅ Notification Button Location
- **Issue**: Notification drawer opens from side, should be in navbar
- **Fix**:
  - Moved `NotificationCenter` component to the header
  - Updated `Header.tsx` to include notifications in top bar
  - Removed duplicate notification components
  - Proper integration with existing notification system

### 4. ✅ User Profile & Settings Pages
- **Issue**: Profile and Settings weren't working
- **Fix**:
  - Created dedicated `Profile.tsx` page with user information display

  - Added routes for `/profile` and `/settings`
  - Integrated with sidebar navigation
  - Added proper empty states and loading states

### 5. ✅ Admin User Creation

  - Added manual instructions (`scripts/create-admin-simple.md`)
  - Updated environment variables documentation
  - Added npm script: `npm run create-admin`

### 6. ✅ Empty States
- **Issue**: Pages without data should have clean empty states
- **Fix**:
  - Created reusable `EmptyState.tsx` component
  - Existing components already had good empty states (BookingList, etc.)
